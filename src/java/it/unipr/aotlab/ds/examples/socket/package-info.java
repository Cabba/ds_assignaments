/**
 *
 * Provides four examples describing the TCP and UDP socket communication.
 *
 * The first TCP example is based on two processes defined by the DataServer
 * and DataClient classes that exchange strings and the DataServer process
 * needs to be started before the DataClient process.
 *
 * The second TCP example is based on two processes defined by the
 * ObjectServer and ObjectClient classes that exchange objects and the
 * ObjectServer process needs to be started before the ObjectClient process.
 *
 * The first UDP example is based on two processes defined by the DataReceiver
 * and DataSender classes that exchange strings and the DataReceiver process
 * needs to be started before the DataSender process.
 *
 * The second UDP example is based on two processes defined by the
 * ObjectReceiver and ObjectSender classes that exchange objects and the
 * ObjectReceiver process needs to be started before the ObjectSender process.
